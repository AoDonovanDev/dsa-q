Design how you could design a browser back/forward system using two stacks, so that you can visit a series of sites 
(Google, Yahoo, EBay, go back to Yahoo, then forward again to EBay, then onto Apple, and so on).

Write pseudo-code for this.

node {
    val: val,
    forward: null,
    back: null
}


backStack{
    the back stack is enqueued as new pages are visited 
}

forwardStack{
    the forward stack is enqueued as the backStack is traversed
}

next(){
    instead of popping things off, simply traverse stack
    in whichever direction
    }
